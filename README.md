Description: An application based on FastAPI that is used to help keep track of simulated medication inventory used in simulation labs across an organization.

Prerequisites: This app is configured to utilize a sqlite3 database. You can make the necessary changes to the code to allow usage with other database types. In order to create the sqlite3 database within the root directory, you will need to execute the following:

python -m app/models/models

This will essentially build the database and create the tables for the project.
